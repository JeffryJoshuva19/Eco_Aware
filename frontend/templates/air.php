      <h3>Automobiles</h3>
      <p>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="frontend/resource/smokestacks.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Factories and Industries</h3>
      <p>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="frontend/resource/amonia.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Agricultural Activities</h3>
      <p>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.</p>

      <h3>Domestic Sources</h3>
      <p>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</p>

    </div>

      <img src="frontend/resource/coal.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h3>
      <p>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      
      <img src="frontend/resource/mines.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Mining Activities</h3>
      <p>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas</p>

    <h2>1. Using public transports</h2>
    <p>Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money. Lesser vehicles on roads will contribute to lesser emissions.</p>

    <h2>2. Turn off the lights when not in use</h2>
    <p>The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.</p>

    <h2>6. Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner</h2>
    <p>The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p>
