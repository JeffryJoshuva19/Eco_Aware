    <h1>Causes of air pollution?</h1>
</div>
  <div class="cards-container">
  <p>Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.</p>

  <div class="cards-container">

    <div class="card">
    <img src="resource/car.jpeg" alt="">
      <h3>Automobiles</h3>
      <p>The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="resource/smokestacks.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Factories and Industries</h3>
      <p>Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.</p>

      <img src="resource/amonia.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Agricultural Activities</h3>
      <p>Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.</p>

      <h3>Domestic Sources</h3>
      <p>The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</p>

      <h3>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h3>
      <p>The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.</p>

      <h3>Mining Activities</h3>
      <p>In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas</p>

    <h2>1. Using public transports</h2>
    <p>Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money. Lesser vehicles on roads will contribute to lesser emissions.</p>

  </div>
    <h2>2. Turn off the lights when not in use</h2>
    <p>The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.</p>

  </div>
    <h2>3. Reduction of fires and smoking</h2>
    <p>The collecting of garbage and getting it on fire in dry seasons or dry leaves catching fires is a huge factor for causing air pollution, moreover smoking also causes air pollution and causes the air quality to worsen along with obviously damaging one’s health.</p>

    <h2>4. Avoid usage of crackers</h2>
    <p>The use of crackers during festivals and weddings is sadly one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, leading to a layer of smog which is extremely harmful for health. So, practice of no crackers should be implemented.</p>

    <h2>5. Avoid using of products with chemicals</h2>
    <p>Products that use the chemicals in their usage or smell strongly, like paints or perfumes should be used less or outside the house. There can also be an alternative to use products with low chemical content and organic properties.</p>

    <h2>6. Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner</h2>
    <p>The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p>
