      <p style="font-family: 'caladea';">switch that makes a big difference. Using toxic chemicals like bleach and ammonia to clean your home is not only bad for the water supply, it's not necessary. With natural cleaners, you don't have to worry that you're contributing to water pollution when you use them.</p>

      <p>Never pour something that isn't biodegradable down the drain. When it is necessary to use something that's toxic to the water supply, such as paint or ammonia, take care to dispose of it properly. If you're not sure how to get rid of something, check your local government's website or contact your sanitation department to find out how toxic waste should be disposed of in your community. The following materials should never be poured down the drain:</p>

      <p>Conservation is an important way to help preserve water as a global resource.[3] Treating water so it's clean enough to drink and use around the house requires a lot of energy, so it's important to conserve as much as possible, especially in areas where droughts are occurring. Adopt the following habits to conserve more water around your house:</p>

      </div>
      <img class="point-image" src="frontend/resource/plastic.jpg" alt="Big Image">
      <p>Since it isn't biodegradable, plastic often ends up collecting in water sources. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for example, is a huge vortex of trash, mainly plastic, that has collected in the ocean since it has nowhere else to go.[5] This trash endangers marine life and affects humans as well. Whenever possible, use glass or cloth containers instead of plastic.</p>

      <p>These chemicals leach deep into the ground and get into the groundwater below. Contaminated groundwater can have a negative effect on the environment as well as the people who depend on it. Switch to natural methods for getting rid of pests and weeds.</p>

      <p>Encourage and educate your peers to get involved. You can take the same actions at work or school that you'd take at home to reduce water pollution. Look into the policies at your workplace or school and find out if there are changes you could help to facilitate to create a pollution-free environment. Getting classmates, teachers, and coworkers involved is a great way to educate others and make a difference.</p>

      <p>Volunteer for a cleanup day in your city to purify local waterways. If you live near a local body of water, there's a lot you can do to help reduce pollution there. See if there's a group working to clean up local beaches, lakes, rivers or oceans.</p>

      <img class="point-image" src="frontend/resource/grass.jpg" alt="Big Image">
      <p>Keeping your lawn is much better for the environment. When a house is surrounded by concrete patios and other surfaces, chemicals pool and runoff leaches into the groundwater instead of getting evenly distributed staying closer to the surface. It might be tempting to pave over your yard so you don't have to deal with mowing the lawn, but it’ll have a negative impact.</p>

      </div>
      <img class="point-image" src="frontend/resource/plant2.avif" alt="Big Image">
      <p>Plant tree and local ground cover to support your soil. When soil gets eroded and ends up in streams, rivers and other waterways, chemicals that exist in soil mix with the water and create problems for plant and animal life. For example, when phosphorus levels get too high in a body of water, they lead to algae blooms that can kill fish populations. The plants' roots hold the soil in place and keep it from falling into the water.</p>
