      <h3>SEWAGE AND WASTEWATER</h3>
      <p>Inadequate sewage collection and treatment are sources of water pollution. According to the United Nations, more than 80% of the worldwide wastewater goes back in the environment without being treated or reused.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resource/deforest.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>URBANIZATION AND DEFORESTATION</h3>
      <p>Even though it does not have a direct impact on water quality, urbanization and deforestation have a lot of indirect effects. For instance, cutting down trees and concreting over large areas generates an acceleration of flows which does not give enough time for water to infiltrate and be purified by the ground.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <img src="resource/agriculture.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>AGRICULTURE</h3>
      <p>Agriculture has an impact on water pollution due to the use of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides or insecticides running off in the water, as well as livestock excrement, manure and methane (greenhouse effect). Regarding aquaculture, pollution is directly in the water, as excess food and fertilizers are causing dystrophication. </p>

      <img src="resource/industry.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>INDUSTRIES</h3>
      <p>Industries produce a lot of waste containing toxic chemicals and pollutants. A huge amount of the industrial waste is drained in the fresh water which then flows into canals, rivers and eventually in the sea. Another source of water pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, causing air pollution like acid rain which then flows to streams, lakes, and other stretches of water.</p>

    <div class="card">
      
      <img src="resource/dumping.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>MARINE DUMPING</h3>
      <p>Everyday, garbage such as plastic, paper, aluminum, food, glass, or rubber are deposited into the sea. These items take weeks to hundreds of years to decompose, and thus they are a major cause for water pollution.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      
      <img src="resource/radioactive.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>RADIOACTIVE WASTE</h3>
      <p>Generated - among others - by power plants and uranium mining, radioactive waste can linger in the environment for thousands of years. When these substances are released accidentally or disposed improperly, they threaten groundwater, surface water, as well as marine resources.</p>

    <h2>1. Wastewater treatment</h2>
    <p>Wastewater treatment consists of removing pollutants from wastewater through a physical, chemical or biological process. The more efficient these processes are, the cleaner the water becomes.</p>

    <h2>2. Green agriculture</h2>
    <p>Globally, agriculture accounts for 70% of water resources, so it is essential to have climate-friendly crops, efficient irrigation that reduces the need for water and energy-efficient food production. Green agriculture is also crucial to limit the chemicals that enter the water.</p>

    <h2>3. Stormwater management</h2>
    <p>Stormwater management is the effort to reduce runoff of rainwater or melted snow into streets, lawns and other sites and the improvement of water quality” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is important to avoid pollutants from contaminating the water and helps to use water more efficiently.</p>

  </div>
    <h2>4. Air pollution prevention</h2>
    <p>Air pollution has a direct impact on water contamination as 25% of human induced CO2 emissions are absorbed by oceans. This pollution causes a rapid acidification of our oceans, and threatens marine life and corals. Preventing air pollution is the best way to prevent this from happening.</p>

    <h2>5. Plastic waste reduction</h2>
    <p>80% of plastic in our oceans is from land sources. In order to reduce the amount of plastic entering our ocean, we need to both reduce our use of plastic globally, and to improve plastic waste management.</p>

    <h2>6. Water conservation</h2>
    <p>Without water conservation, we won’t go very far. It is central in making sure the world has better access to clean water. It means being aware that water is a scarce resource, taking care of it accordingly, and managing it responsibly.</p>
