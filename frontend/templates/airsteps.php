      <p>Walking, cycling, or even scooting to school is a fantastic way to start the day.
Start good habits early. Kids who include physical activity in their daily lives are more likely to be active in adult life.
There's plenty of benefits to your own health. And you'll be reducing air pollution and congestion around the school gates.</p>

      <p>Domestic burning has increased over the last decade, becoming the largest contributor to the UK’s particulate matter emissions.

Burning solid fuels, such as in open fires and wood-burning stoves have a significant impact on air pollution. Avoid burning leaves and rubbish in your garden too.</p>

      <p>Use of public transport to avoid pollution
Use Public Transportation to Reduce Air Pollution. Facts and figures don’t lie — our transportation needs produce 30% of all carbon dioxide gas emissions. We can use public buses instead of using private cars or vehicles. Let’s say a bus can carry 40 passengers at once; these 40 passengers can reduce the emissions of 40 private vehicles by using one public vehicle instead. Many public vehicles run on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). CNG consists of a very large amount of methane (CH₄). CH₄ burns cleaner than some other fuels, reducing ash emissions. As a result, it reduces the number of fine particles in the air.</p>

      <p style="font-family:'caladea';">Encourage and educate your peers to get involved. You can take the same actions at work or school that you'd take at home to reduce water pollution. Look into the policies at your workplace or school and find out if there are changes you could help to facilitate to create a pollution-free environment. Getting classmates, teachers, and coworkers involved is a great way to educate others and make a difference.</p>
